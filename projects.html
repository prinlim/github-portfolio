				<p> As young adults, we were tasked with helping our peers by making a website for future, potential employers. I had interviewed my fellow classmate, Jafnun Lisa and applied her information onto the page. I included her goals, educational bakground, and personal information. My particular difficulties with this project was adjusting the image gallery for the education section, yet for strengths, I believe there is visual appeal in color scheme and font to the website.   </p>

				<p> Advancing into javascript, we were tasked to apply the jQuery library with this project. Among the criteria, we were required to add multiple functions, such as dlbclick or hover to ensure a interactive game for users to play. I was able to implement these features successfully and if I had more time, I would have added more endings or "scenes" to make it more enticing. </p>

				<p> A social-media page starring someone you admire or respect, including fictional, had been the prompt for this project. I had chosen Megamind and created a wireframe inspired from MySpace formatting, ultimately creating a website that highlighted quotes, friends, achievenments, and overall personality. Difficulties encountered were grouping together different divs and the scroll feature on the posts.  </p>

				<p> Diving further into javascript, we needed implemented if-else statements in order to create a functioning character quiz. The user would input string values and an integer when asked, where specific inputs would output different Minion characters. It was at first difficult to integrate conditionals since I had no idea how to first, but I eventually figured it out. It was tedious but I had successfully made an effective quiz. </p>

				<p> Progressing onto arrays, we were tasked to create a photo gallery that includes the user's input of their own image and caption of The append function was predominatnly used and I found it hard to connect the add and remove buttons to the list. But with thorough collaboration, I had sucessfully made a functional photo gallery and I am proud of the final result, especially the CSS. </p>

			<p> Along with my team and I, the project had asked to focus on a current social issue prolonging in the world. As young women in this country and society, we chose reproductive rights and how to educate others on the topic. Specifically, the court case that legalized abortion in America, Roe v. Wade, that had recently been overturned. Our goal was to spread awareness and ways to help for the cause.     </p>
